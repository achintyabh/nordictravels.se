                            was originally a Family-Run Skiing business in the 1930's, aiming to compete with
                            the Austrian Skiing companies. They set up stands in all the big cities; Moscow, London,
                            Paris,
                            New York, Barcelona, Berlin, Bonn, Montreal, you name it! It was based in Uppsala, Sweden,
                            and
                            was recently purchased by the Nordic Co-Operation as an official tour representative of the
                            Nordic Council. We get 85% of our funding directly from the European Union, and we only get
                            about 15% of our funding through sales. </p>
